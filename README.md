Here is a sample project, common in team orientated projects. You've received a task to proceed with completing the following updates to a controller; however, the project manager seems rushed and has provided very little instructions. 

1) Validate user input
2) Save data to (mock) database
3) Generate PDF using user input and registration #
4) Send confirmation email with attachment to dev@arcane.ws

Complete the tasks to the best of your ability and provide any feedback notes for the project manager to understand your changes.
